# shopping-app
A fully complete shopping app with shopping cart implementation using JavaScript. This project will contain a fully complete website that contains a landing page, which will introduce a small business that sells crafting goods for those who are interested in cosplay, as well as accessories from various video games. This project was inspired by my sister's hobby, who creates such items and accessories.
