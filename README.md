# shopping-app
A fully complete shopping app with shopping cart implementation using JavaScript. This project will contain a fully complete website that contains a landing page, which will introduce a small business that sells crafting goods for those who are interested in cosplay, as well as accessories from various video games. This project was inspired by my sister's hobby, who creates such items and accessories.

-----------------------

Day 8: Added full functionality of website

Eigth submission contains full functionality of website. Website contains basic functionality of an e-commerce shopping cart, as well as clean design to showcase a small business selling crafts. This won't be the final FINAL submission, but rather acting as the first demo of the final product.

Final thoughts and issues:
- Figure out how to make the shopping cart work on both the home page and products page (only updates the products page; find a way to save the data from that particular div, and copy it onto the home page)
- Make a 'subscribe to newsletter' notification when a user inputs an email and clicks subscribe (Currently just using alert() as filler)
- Maybe make a contact page just to show that nothing for a small business page is missing (most small business will obviously want to share their contact info with their customers)
- In the end, this project was entire meant to showcase the use of a shopping cart, being able to add and delete items from your cart. It still had a goal to showcase  clean design, and clean code throughout, by make the website responsive.
